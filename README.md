# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Matt

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering Apprentice at Apple, currently working in the Data Team after previously being part of the Quality Assurance & Software Testing Team. My experience spans testing, automation, cloud technologies, and data workflows, but Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set beyond just what Iâ€™ve worked on.

While my GitHub is mostly empty right now due to work restrictions, thatâ€™s about to changeâ€”Iâ€™ll be posting more personal projects as I explore new technologies, build cool things, and experiment with ideas outside of work.
