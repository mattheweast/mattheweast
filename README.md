# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Matt

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering Apprentice at Apple, currently working in the Data Team after previously being part of the Quality Assurance & Software Testing Team. My experience spans testing, automation, cloud technologies, and data workflows, but Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set beyond just what Iâ€™ve worked on.

While my GitHub is mostly empty right now due to work restrictions, thatâ€™s about to changeâ€”Iâ€™ll be posting more personal projects as I explore new technologies, build cool things, and experiment with ideas outside of work.

ðŸŽ“ Former Apple Genius turned Software Engineer Apprentice, I recently completed a 5-month Software Engineering bootcamp at Makers Academy and am now gaining real-world experience through my Level 4 apprenticeship. I started in QA automation and have since transitioned into Data Engineering.

ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working on my final Level 4 project, building a data pipeline using Scala, Python, SQL, Terraform, BigQuery, and GCS.

ðŸ“š Outside of work, Iâ€™m actively expanding my skill set through courses and personal projects. My main focus is mybooks, a custom Management System designed to track, manage, and analyze your books efficiently.

ðŸŒ± Passionate about continuous learning and problem-solving, I thrive in collaborative environments and am currently seeking Software Engineering roles to further develop my expertise and contribute to innovative projects.
